# Eight Queens Game

This project is a practice based on solving the classic Eight Queens Problem.

The objective of the game is to place 8 queens on a chessboard without any of them attacking each other.

The **main** branch contains the obfuscated version of the code.

If you need the original, clean, and unobfuscated source code for reference or learning purposes, please switch to the branch:
**NoObfuscation**
